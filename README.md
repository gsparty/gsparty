- 👋 Hi, I’m @gsparty
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, creativity and making the world a better place :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning for my module, scientific programming, but am also aiming to improve my skills on my way as a security analyst
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything that will teach me the ropes
- 📫 How to reach me: Mainly on my email: daniel.brody00@gmail.com  
- ⚡ Fun fact: You know that saying about six degrees of separation? Well, it means that you and I are probably connected by just a few people. Like, you know someone, who knows someone, and so on, and it takes only about six connections to link us all together. It's kinda cool to think about how even though we live all over the world and lead different lives, we're all sort of connected in this big social web.
